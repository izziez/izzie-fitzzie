<h2 class= "hi"> Hi :)</h2>

<h4>I’m Izzie and I am so excited you took the time to check out my blog!</h4>

<h4>Here are a few things about me:</h4>
<p class= "About">
	<i class="fa fa-thumbs-o-up"></i> My name is Izzie (short for Elizabeth) and I am 26 years old :)
</p>
<p class= "About">
	<i class="fa fa-paw"></i> I have the cutest most awesome dog in the world- his name is George- you will see him a lot in my post.
</p>
<p class= "About">
	<i class="fa fa-coffee"></i> My favorite things are coffee, donuts, waffles, french toast- basically breakfast foods- Breakfast for dinner is the best.
</p>
<p class= "About">
	<i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i> I am obsessed with Lululemon & VS- they have the cutest workout gear :)
</p>
<p class= "About">
	<i class="fa fa-birthday-cake"></i> Leslie Knope is my role-model.. always try to be the Leslie Knope of whatever you do!
</p>
<p class= "About">
	<i class="fa fa-heartbeat"></i> I have always been somewhat active (some years more than others… cough.. college.. cough) but I have gotten really immersed over the past 6 months.
</p>
<p class= "About">
	<i class="fa fa-trophy"></i> I started riding horses when I was 5. I tried out a lot of different styles of riding but ultimately ended up loving the eventing world. I rode for Area 3 in the National Young Rider and Junior Olympics team twice- once with a New Zealand thoroughbred named Kenny and once with a Holsteiner/Thoroughbred mare named Selina.
</p>
<p class= "About">
	<i class="fa fa-university"></i> When I was in college I decided I wanted to pursue school so I put the horseback riding on hold… sometimes I wonder if that was a mistake but I wouldn’t be where I am today if I hadn’t gone that route!
</p>
<p class= "About">
	<i class="fa fa-graduation-cap"></i> I graduated from The University of Georgia in 2011. Go Dawgs!
</p>
<p class= "About">
	<i class="fa fa-heart"></i> After graduation I moved to Breckenridge, CO for a job in hospitality- where I met my Fiance Brian- Our 2nd date was a roadtrip from Colorado to North Carolina with both of our dogs.
</p>
<p class= "About">
	<i class="fa fa-car"></i> We have since driven half way across the country 4 times! We have lived in Breckenridge, CO; Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming; Laguna Beach, CA and now Charlotte, NC. Brian Proposed in April of 2014 on a beautiful cliff overlooking the ocean in Big Sur, CA and we are getting married back home in Georgia on October of 2015.
</p>
<p class= "About">
	<i class="fa fa-terminal"></i> I'm a website developer from 9-5 and a fitness junkie 24/7. (insert joke about backend development :P)
</p>
<p class= "About">
	<i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o"></i> My goal with this blog is to share my fitness ambitions with others in hopes of inspiring or helping other people to reach their goals. I am by no means a certified personal trainer and I am 100% learning as I go. Brian has been a great help and inspiration to me but just like everyone else I am sifting through the incredibly huge amount of fitness information and programs that all seem to contradict each other! Maybe you can find something I do that will help you out or I can teach you something to not do through my experiences! Either way I hope your at least enjoy reading about my adventures!
